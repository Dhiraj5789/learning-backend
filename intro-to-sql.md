SQL vs NoSQL

SQL
Tables - Records(rows), Fields(columns), Relations

Core Characteristics-
1. Data Schema (All data has to fit)
2. Data Relations - (1-to-1, 1-to-many, many-to-many)

Queries - Combination of keywords/syntac and parameters


NoSQL
Tables are called collections (can be considered as tables)
Documents without schema(like objects)
No relations
Can be very fast and efficient 

Core Characteristics-
No data schema, no structure required and no data relations (we can relate documents but we shouldnâ€™t do it too much or our queries become slow)=> No/few connections


Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

Horizontal - Add more servers (and merge data into one database) - Limitless
Vertical Scaling - Improve server capacity(Memory)/hardware(CPU, RAM, etc) - Limited
